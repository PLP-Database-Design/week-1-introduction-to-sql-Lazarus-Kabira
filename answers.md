State and Explain the components of a DBMS(Database Management System)

          1. Hardware:
                 This includes physical components like servers, storage devices (hard drives, SSDs), and network infrastructure.
          2. Software:
                This comprises the software applications that manage and control the database.
                    DBMS Software: The core software responsible for database creation, data manipulation, query processing, and security.
                    Operating System: The underlying OS provides the environment for the DBMS to run.
                    Network Software: Enables data sharing and communication between different systems.
                    Application Software: Tools used to interact with the database, such as data entry applications, reporting tools, and data analysis tools.  
          3. Data:
                This is the raw information stored in the database, organized into tables, records, and fields.   
          4.  Database Access Language:
                A language used to interact with the database, such as SQL (Structured Query Language).    
          5.  Procedures:
                These are the rules, guidelines, and processes that govern how data is stored, accessed, and modified.

What is a relational database? Give 4 examples.

            A relational database is a database that stores data in tables.These tables are related to each other through common fields, called keys. This structure allows for efficient data organization, retrieval, and manipulation.
            examples of relational databases: E-commerce Database, Library Database, University Database, Inventory Database

State and Explain three classifications of SQL?

             Data Definition Language (DDL):
                          Used to define the structure of a database.
             Data Manipulation Language (DML):
                         Used to manipulate data within a database.             
             Data Control Language (DCL):
                         Used to control access to data within a database.     

What is the difference between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key?

          Primary Key:

             A unique identifier for each record in a table.
             Ensures data integrity and prevents duplicate records.
             Cannot contain null values.
             Each table can have only one primary key.
          Foreign Key:

              A column or set of columns in one table that references the primary key of another table.
              Establishes a link between two tables, creating a parent-child relationship.
              Can contain null values.
              A table can have multiple foreign keys.

What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram?

              An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of how different entities (objects or concepts) relate to each other within a database.It's a blueprint for designing databases, helping to ensure data consistency and integrity. Â  

What are the advantages of relational databases?

               Data Integrity
               Data Security
               Flexibility and Adaptability
               Data Standardization
               Powerful Querying Capabilities

State four types of data type used to store data in tables?

               Integer: Used for whole numbers, both positive and negative.
                       Examples: INT, SMALLINT, BIGINT
               Decimal: Used for numbers with decimal points.
                       Examples: DECIMAL, NUMERIC
               Character: Used for storing text data.
                       Examples: CHAR, VARCHAR
               Date and Time: Used for storing dates and times.
                       Examples: DATE, TIME, DATETIME

What is the purpose of a database management system (DBMS)?

               Data Storage
               Data Retrieval
               Data Manipulation
               Data Security
               Data Backup and Recovery
